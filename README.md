# Keyboard for leap
A keyboard plugin for the leap motion controller

Quick update (08/17/2015) - The WebGL graphics are something that I am having trouble with. I have gotten a few buttons to work along tthe XZ axis but the graphics for the keyboard remain a problem. Will be figuring out that problem soon and then commiting.
